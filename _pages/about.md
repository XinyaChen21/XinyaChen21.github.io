<p>
  I am a PhD student at the
  <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning">
    Max Planck Institute for Informatics
  </a>,
  supervised by
  <a href="https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/people/lenssen.html">Jan Eric Lenssen</a>.
  Previously, I was a research assistant at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University">Zhejiang University</a>,
  working with
  <a href="https://yiyiliao.github.io/">Prof. Yiyi Liao</a>,
  and before that a computer vision engineer at
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok">TikTok, ByteDance</a>.
  I received my M.E. degree from
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology">
    Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)
  </a>,
  advised by
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ky_ZowEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Nong Sang</a>,
  and my B.E. degree from HUST.

My interests lie at the intersection of **3D computer vision** and **generative models**, including **generative novel view synthesis** and **3D-aware generative models**.
 <!-- My past research also involves building human-level intelligent systems, including 3D human pose and shape estimation, 2d human pose estimation and crowd counting. -->
<!-- My research interest lies in neural rendering, including 3d-aware generative model for human and in the wild objects. -->
